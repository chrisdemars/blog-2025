Happy Halloween guys and ghouls! It has been a little while since I wrote about anything. I have been meaning to, but just need a little oomph…that little oomph came today in a YouTube comment.

## The Gist

So there seemed to be a small YouTube comment war between myself and a couple other ppl over learning and groking JavaScript and having that as a sufficient skill under your toolbelt. I believe the words were.

> dont you need JS to be a Web developer? I mean thats like programming 101 for a decent Web dev IMO.

Hmm…what about the debate between what being a developer means, opposed to being a programmer. I never said I was programmer. I would also argue that programming 101 and Web dev 101 are two totally different things. That is like comparing Java to JavaScript.

## The Truth

The fact of the matter is this. You do not have to be a JavaScript expert to be a Web developer. Ask yourself this question, “do I write code that is used on the Web?”. If the answer is yes, than you are a Web developer. My strength lies in the UI, I am not a JavaScript expert. It has taken me a couple years to finally start groking the inner workings of JavaScript, outside of basic concepts and functionality, and still it is my greatest weakness.

All that aside, I accepted a senior ui developer position for a company here in Metro Detroit and the company knows I have a weakness in the JavaScript universe. Do I know JavaScript? Yes. Am I an expert JavaScript developer? No. Do I write code for the Web? Yes. Well than, I guess that buries the hatchet on that comment.
