Being a part of the community and building relationships has been one of the best parts of being a developer advocate. I have been a front end developer since the mid-90's and specialize in different aspects of the front end.

I was recently working as a Senior Developer Advocate at DigitalOcean. At DigitalOcean, I played a key role in developer engagement and content strategy, contributing to the revitalization of CSS-Tricks through blogging and content creation. I delivered technical presentations and workshops at industry conferences, focusing on Cloud and Generative AI. Additionally, I launched and led CloudChats on Twitch, strengthening live developer interactions. My work in producing YouTube videos, Shorts, and social media content helped expand DigitalOcean’s reach and community impact.

Beyond content creation, I served as Master of Ceremonies for Hacktoberfest, driving engagement in one of DigitalOcean’s largest community events. I collaborated with the App Platform team, influencing roadmap decisions and enhancing community engagement. My focus on tracking key performance metrics ensured that goals were consistently exceeded by 100%. Additionally, I co-hosted a webinar with Tabnine, educating developers on deployment strategies, and fostered cross-functional collaboration to align initiatives with community objectives.

Having the background as a developer, I feel I can relate and empathize with the developer community when it comes to problems, setbacks, and bottlenecks. I aim to be the best bridge I can be between the product and the developer; helping them a long the way as much as I can.

Below you can find a list of some of the contributions to the community I have achieved.
